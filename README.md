# Voice In commands for use when writing about Emacs.

## Problem address

There are many strange names for packages and commands in Emacs that are often misinterpreted by Voice In.
This library of text replacements is meant to correct these recurring errors.
There is a related Library, *org-mode-voice-in*, that is org-mode specific.
The *emacs-voice-in* library is meant to contain text replacements for the rest of Emacs outside of org-mode.
